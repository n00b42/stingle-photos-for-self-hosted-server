# Stingle Photos for Self Hosted Server

This is a fork of the Stingle Photos App that lets you connect to your own (or
any other) server. It can be used with [c2FmZQ Server](https://c2FmZQ.org), or
any other server that implements the same API.

The master branch is occasionally rebased from https://github.com/stingle/stingle-photos-android.git
